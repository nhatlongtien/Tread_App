# Tread_App
- This is a app to help runner or jogger manage their exercise. This app have some functions for example: The first it can measure the duration, pace, distance of the user. The next it can redraw the path on the map. The final function is able to save history of user.
- In this app I used some technique such as:
    + CoreLocation: to handle functions related to user location.
    + realm: To save the data of user in local.
- There are some picture of this app.
